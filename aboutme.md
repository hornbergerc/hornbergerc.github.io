TL:DR Cayton is a student who is surrounded by software

My name is Cayton Hornberger and I am a freshmen at Allegheny College. I grew up in Coatesville, Pa. and went to Coatesville Area Senior High School. Throughout high school, I ran cross country and track and field. I wanted to run to stay in shape, but then found out that I like running. I started out running my 10th grade year and I was slower then most of the team, but over the next three years, I improved and made it to varsity. Then, my senior year for outdoor track, I tried pole vaulting and I enjoyed that more then running. Even though I had limited time to learn how to pole vault, I was able to qualify for the league meet.

Before high school and in my early childhood, I raced race cars and continued till I went to college. I went to a local track and watched the races at age four. Then at four and half, I started practicing and at age five, I was racing. I raced quarter midgets from the start till age fourteen and then I raced mini cups from age fourteen till age seventeen. In my fifteen years of racing, I won three track points championships, a United States Auto Club (USAC) tri-track series, a Quarter Midgets of America (QMA) Eastern Grand National race, Buckeye indoor series championship, and many races in quarter midgets. In mini cups, I raced an indoor series, Arena Racing USA, (ARUSA) for one season and then I raced an outdoor series, Shenandoah Valley Scale Racing League, (SVSRL). I won most improved driver in ARUSA in 2014 and I won the points championship in 2015 for SVSRL. In the SVSRL series, I raced for one season and won four out of the eleven races and finished with in the top five in all the races.

At Allegheny College, I am on the track for being a Physics major with an undecided minor. In the few months that I have been at college, I have made some great friends and memories. I was presented with opportunities that I would never have thought that I would be able to do, such as explore Pittsburgh with friends or go on outdoors trips like paint balling or high ropes courses.

The theme of this course, "Software Everywhere", relates to my life because I use software with racing while scaling the race cars or using computer programs to simulate situations. I also use software by using my phone or playing video games. Software is everywhere around me and it is used daily.
