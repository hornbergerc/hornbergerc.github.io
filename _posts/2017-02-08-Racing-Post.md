### TL:DR Auto Racing has improved through technology

Over the years, racing has improved, either from the safety to the durability of parts. Early race cars of any type didn't have roll cages or safety features. As time went on, racing organizations made roll cages standard. With the improvement, the racing became safer. The safety equipment that drivers wear also became safer with there fire retardant levels and the impact that helmets can take.

There is another side that improved, the use of technology in the cars. Electrical systems and components have been added to monitor the engine or other aspects of the race car or track. Years ago, people would set up there cars and race. Now, they can use digital scales to accurately see percentages and weights of the car. The numbers are very important because different numbers work for different tracks. A slightly higher of lower number would change how the car transfers its weight or how the car enters a corner or exits a corner. As time went on and the Internet came about, videos of racing were posted. From the videos, people can study them and learn how opponents race and how there cars handle around the track. With the new knowledge, drivers can predict what an opponent will do on the track when they are racing against them. The electrical systems in cars are really complex and compacted now a days, but they run a variety of tasks and readings. A computer can be hooked up to the electrical systems to read what happened during a race or practice session. The system is recording how much fuel is going into the carburetors, how much braking is being used, the performance of the engine, and a few other tasks. To better understand how cars handle around a track, sensors can be hooked up to the car. As the car is racing around the track, the sensors gather data about the banking of the track and other information. From the information, a computer can simulate the car and track. Then with a program, the car and track can be set up and someone could make changes to the car through the program and see how the car would react to the changes on the track. With this system, race teams can save money because they wouldn't have to rent a track for as many hours. They would have a good idea of what to change.

I have used many methods above in my racing to help me. I have had friends video tape my races and I will watch them over and over to see where I could improve. I will also watch the other competitors and see what they did. Digital scales have greatly improved the efficiency and precision of setting up my race cars.
