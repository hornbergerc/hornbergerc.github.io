### TL:DR The use of mapping services have had a negative effect on people

"How do I get there?" is a common question that people ask when they are going places for the first time. The answer that people find will be to look at there phones or gps. That is a great idea, but what if there is no connection or the battery dies in the device? The user runs into a problem.

In a survey, nine out of ten people do not have an atlas in there car. So, with a dead device and no atlas, people who are traveling somewhere for the first time are lost.

Another problem would be the maps aren't up to date. With people relying on a digital mapping service, they will take for granite that the roads are there. Roads are under construction or are always changing and the mapping service is not up-to-date. Users could miss an exit or have to go another way and waste time.

people don't know how to use an atlas, time restraints
