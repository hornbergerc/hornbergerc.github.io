### TL;DR Plagiarism can be committed by anyone, but usually the students gets the blame, when it could actually be the teachers.


In the discussion of plagiarism, one controversial topic is "who should be blamed for plagiarism &mdash; the student or the teacher?” Whenever someone gets caught for plagiarism, they are the one who gets blamed. People tend not to think about the person’s education or their background. A possibility could be that the student was not taught about plagiarism or the consequences. Then the blame should get placed on the teacher for not teaching the material. Susan Blum wrote in her article, “Academic Integrity and Student Plagiarism: a Question of Education, Not Ethics,” “students only have a vague sense of what is meant by the moral quality termed “academic integrity.”” From that statement, she believes that students are briefly taught about plagiarism. She also brought up a point that students are focused on getting good grades and excelling, they have grown up in a society that is all about doing well in school and getting a degree. Without a degree, students believe that they can’t make as much money and won’t be as successful. This adds more stress to students about doing well in school.

After reading Susan Blum’s article, I agree with her about it’s not the student’s fault all the time. Yes, there are cases where students directly plagiarize and that’s wrong, but the majority of the time, the students just don’t know and then they have to pay the consequences, whether it’s getting a zero on the assignment all the way to getting expelled from school.

Teachers who believe they are not at fault might say that if students paid attention in class, then they would not have problems with plagiarism. Students might get distracted by their phones or by talking to other students. The teachers argue that they have taught about plagiarism for about two classes and those classes are enough for the students to learn. Students tend to take more than two classes to learn something new, and a new solution should be created.

Plagiarism is a problem, but there is a solution that could be implemented, which is to add teaching plagiarism to the curriculum. The addition of this would educate students and promote them not to plagiarize. With an updated and more involved curriculum, students will be able to learn how not to plagiarize and learn about the consequences of it over a few weeks program. In the curriculum, teachers will give examples of plagiarized papers and articles, talk about what plagiarism is, mention what the consequences are, and how students can properly cite and not plagiarize. After the completion of the plagiarism section in the curriculum, students would be tested and asked about the material. This solution would clarify what plagiarism is and how students can learn how not to plagiarize and not get in trouble.

In conclusion, students are not taught about plagiarism correctly, and as a result, they could get in trouble. The reason is that teachers just rush through or don’t explain plagiarism. A solution about expanding the plagiarism curriculum can be implemented into school programs, and the students would benefit by not plagiarizing and the teachers would not be the ones to get blamed for not teaching students.
