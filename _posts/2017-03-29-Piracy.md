### TL:DR An interview from a friend about piracy and the comparison to the legal laws

Many people have pirated software or music online by accident or on purpose. Some reasons could be to save money or have a new version before it is out. Nonetheless, digital information is being pirated all the time illegally. I conducted an interview with a friend about piracy and the effects.

**1) In your own words, what is digital piracy?**
Downloading and sharing files that belong to someone else illegally.

**2) Do you think pirating software and music should be legal?**
I believe that piracy should be illegal, but the current laws should be changed and people should be more aware of piracy.

**3) What do you think the biggest advantage of pirating software and music is?**
The biggest advantage is that you are getting the software and music for free.

**4) Do you think pirating software and music hurts the developer?**
I think it depends on the developer. If the developer is a small company, then yes because they are small and do not make a large amount of money that can be offset by the lost. If the developer is a large company, then no because they take into account a percentage of lost money from piracy and they make a large amount of money that it will not hurt them.

**5) Do you know of any laws in place to prevent piracy? If so, do you know the consequences?**
Yes, I know a lot of laws that are in place. I know that the FBI could sue people who pirate, people could get arrested or go to court and have to pay fines. The ISB could cut you off from the Internet.

**6) Are there any disadvantages to piracy from the piraters perspective?**
Some disadvantages are that the software could be less reliable or the source that you are using to get the software is less reliable. The software or music can also be harder to find and could take longer then it would take to download from iTunes or another source.

**7) Is the risk of pirating software or music worth the reward of getting the product?**
I personally believe that the risk is worth the reward because there are some art software out there that is super expensive and with a lot of art being created online, people could be at a disadvantage.

**8) Do you think piracy is a huge problem?**
Not as big as it's made out to be.

**9) Why do you think people pirate software or music?**
A lot of the time, the software or music is expensive, so it's cheaper. People also can get satisfaction out of pirating because they could listen to a free music provider, but have to listen to ads all the time, so when they pirate, they can get the same music without the ads.

**10) Do you know anyone who has been convicted of piracy? If, so what was there consequence?**
I personally do not know anyone who has been convicted, but I have heard about people who run Pirate Bay getting arrest or fined along with people who run torrent websites.

After the interview, I talked to my friend and about some research that I conducted about piracy. I found a law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.This act is broken up into five titles and in the third title, the act states "a copy of a computer program in the course of maintaining or repairing" can be made, but then has to be deleted after the repair. Another act that I found was the No Electronic Theft Act of 1997. This act mentions that if an individual makes more then ten copies worth $2,500 or more within an 180-day period, they could receive up to five years in prison and/or $250,000 in fines and they would be charged with a felony. If an individual does not meet that, they would be charged with a misdemeanor and could spend up to one year in prison and/or up to $25,000 in fines.
