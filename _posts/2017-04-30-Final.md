### TL;DR

Modern technology has improved quickly in a short amount of time. The first computer was invented in 1832 and was huge, taking up a room. Nowadays, computers take up little space and have so much power to compute just about anything. Today’s smartphones are more powerful than the technology used in the Apollo 11 spacecraft. The iPhone 7 has anywhere from 32GB to 256GB, while the Apollo 11 had 64Kbyte of memory. This is astonishing that something such as an iPhone is more powerful then something that took people into outer space. Technology has been proven to perform amazing tasks just like Apollo, but there is a challenge of people being unproductive and wasting time. One example is when college students are working on homework, and their phone receives a notification. Majority of the students will stop what they are doing and check their phone. Thus, resulting in them not working on their homework and wasting time. Another example is when someone wants to complete chores or other activities and they watch a movie or show instead. There are only 24 hours in a day and watching a movie or show is great, but not when task should or have to be completed. Watching movies or shows instead of work in unproductive. There were many incidents when I was writing this that I was distracted. Most of the time it was a snapchat or text message. I could have finished a few hours earlier if I didn’t get distracted by those two. Some other distractions were checking my social media accounts or playing a few apps.



At the same time that I believe getting distracted my modern technology is a problem, I also believe there are solutions. One in particular is to turn off all notifications or the phone in general. With having those off, people can focus on their work and not get distracted. Another solution would be downloading an app that locks people out of certain apps. Again, this is similar to turning out the phone or notifications and people can focus on what’s at hand. The third solution would be to work for an hour and then take a few minutes for a break to check whatever they want to check. This would give people’s minds a break and it will also let them check whatever they would like. The final solution that could be implemented would be setting a goal system. This system would work by for every 30-60 minutes that a person doesn’t check their phone, they could get a reward of their choice. Rewards might be a piece of candy, a soda, chips, pretzels, or anything along those lines. This solution is fun because people get something out of completing homework or any task and it’s confidence booster.
